# AdvancedDataStructuresLab5
Created as part of my CS302 Advanced Data Structures at Central Washington University, below are the provided project outlines:

**Problem 1**
Implement a function that takes in two parameters, and has a return value of type int. The first parameter is a
reference to an integer array (arr), and the second one is an integer value (m). The function should return the
largest element in the array that appears at least m times. Your algorithm should be implemented in linear time.
**Problem 2**
You are given an array arr of integers and an integer m. Implement an algorithm that determines in linear
time whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that arr[i] = arr[j] and the difference
between i and j is at most m. The algorithm should use a hash table and return i and j . You can assume
that such a pair always exists in arr.

You can use the class the class java.util.HashMap<K, V> as a hash table for implementation. We assume that
the functions containsKey, get, put and remove of this class run in constant time. You are not allowed to use any
other data structures.
